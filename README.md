# Wind Turbine Project

Helped design and implement electrical components and develop software using Arduino for a three-phase rectifier circuit as part of a 3 person team to build a 9 ft tall wind turbine. 
Wrote test program to measure rotations per minute using a light dependent resistor with a rotating flywheel model
